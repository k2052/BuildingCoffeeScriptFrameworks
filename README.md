# Building CoffeeScript Frameworks

Remember how frustrating it was? Maybe it wasn't in the docs. Maybe it was something you forgot. Or maybe it was just a bug.

We have all been there. The moments when all the magic breaks and the frameworks we use leave us ready to give up and become bike messengers. When magic works, it's wonderful; it makes your projects fly along. You develop faster than you ever had before, and you think "if only I had used this for my last project". But when magic doesn't work it can ruin everything.

This book is about magic. The behind the scenes of the frontend frameworks we use everyday but never bother to dig into. We all know we should read code to improve but few of us ever do. Sometimes we think about it -- maybe clone a repo -- pull up our IDE and take a look around; but where does one even start? 

This book is your guidebook into the world of CoffeeScript frameworks. It covers everything I thought I should know but was too lazy to learn until now.
